# Open Compute Project
The Open Compute Project (OCP) is a global initiative aimed at redefining data center infrastructure through open-source hardware designs. 
By fostering collaboration among industry leaders, OCP has enabled the development of cost-effective, energy-efficient, and scalable solutions for modern data centers.

The Open Compute Project for Hardware and Data Centers is like the Open Source for Software which has accelerated the technology adoption globally.

The motive of these writings is to increase the awareness of **Open Compute Project** in the relanance of Indian, Asian and European martkets and also encourage the Data Center Eco-System to adopt to the OCP Standards to realise and reap the benifits that directly contrubute to a better and safer ecosystem without compromising on the performance or experience of the computing power to the humankind !
